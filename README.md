# Interactive-Web-API-Recommendation

To improve both the optimality and scalability of Web API recommendation, we propose a Light Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering based Web API recommendation approach, named LNGCF. Specifically, LNGCF learns user and item embeddings by linearly propagating them on the user-item interaction graph, and uses the weighted summation of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final embedding. Such simple, linear, and neat model is much easier to implement and train.
